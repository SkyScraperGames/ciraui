    <p>Skyscraper Games was created by the <a href="http://egs.excite.drexel.edu/" target="_blank">Entrepreneurial Game Studio</a> with support from the Intel Corporation. This site features a Python interpreter and a model of the Cira Centre, a 29-story skyscraper in downtown Philadelphia where games created on this site can be broadcast and played. Our goal is to get kids from all backgrounds interested in computational thinking. If you have any questions, you can contact us by email at egs[@]drexel.edu.
