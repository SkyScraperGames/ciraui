    <h1>Pixels</h1>

    <p>When you are on your phone or watching TV all of the pictures you see on your screen are made of pixels. Pixels are the
      smallest piece of these pictures. They are little lights that can be turned on, lit up with color, or turned off. Think
      of a pixel like a Lego brick. Many Legos can come together to make a castle, just like a group of pixels make up a picture
      on a screen.</p>

    <p>The display of the Cira Centre is &nbsp;22 pixels tall by 20 pixels wide. Devices like computers or smartphones have have
      hundreds, or even thousands, of pixels in each direction, which means that the pictures that can be on the Cira Centreâ€™s
      display have tomust be much, much simplermore simple. </p>
    <p>When making a game for the Cira Centre, you need to tell the display what to do with each individual pixel or light. Since
      there are so few, You will need to be careful when you do this to make sure that everything in your game design can fits
      on on the display. </p>

    <h4>Here are some Python functions related to using pixels on the Cira display:</h4>
    <pre><code>clearScreen(r, g, b)</code></pre>
    <pre><code>clearPoint(x, y)</code></pre>
    <pre><code>putPixel(x, y, r, g, b)</code></pre>
